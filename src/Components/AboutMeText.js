	<p style={pStyle}> Good Day! Hello, I'm Jose Paulo Dela Cruz an aspiring Web Developer who lives in the Cabuyao Laguna. I'm currently taking Bachelor of Science in Computer Science 4th Year Student in Citi Global College formerly known as Don Bosco Global College. I am a consecutive scholar of the Goverment of Cabuyao.<br/><br/> I am a ambitious, self-made, work alcoholic but down to earth person. I like to balance professional & family life. Professional life gives you exposure, confidence & sense of achievement. I believe the fulfillment one gets from oneâ€™s work is very important for wellbeing. I also participate in family get-togethers, functions, parties, etc. My favourite pastime is to watch English movies, video about Web Development to keep me up to date what is new to the tech industry.</p>
